In this data analysis project, a structured approach was followed to gather insights from an SQLite database containing Amazon-related data. The process began with Reading Data from SQLite Database, involving the utilization of SQL queries to extract relevant information for analysis.

Data Preparation was a crucial step to ensure the data's quality and suitability for analysis. It encompassed activities such as cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming data as needed.

One of the project's focal points was the exploration of How Amazon Recommends Products, wherein various recommendation algorithms and strategies were likely investigated, shedding light on how Amazon tailors product suggestions to its users.

To gain a better understanding of the product landscape, a subsequent task involved Analyzing which Products Have a Good Number of Reviews. This analysis aimed to pinpoint products with a significant number of reviews, potentially indicating popular or notable items.

Understanding the Behaviors of Amazon Users was another vital aspect of the project. This entailed delving into user interactions, preferences, and habits on the Amazon platform, possibly involving user segmentation and behavior analysis.

An examination of Frequent Users on Amazon was carried out to identify and analyze users who engage with the platform frequently. This analysis could offer insights into customer loyalty and potentially inform strategies to enhance user engagement.

Finally, the project involved the Performing Sentiment Analysis on Data. This step was crucial in gauging the sentiment expressed in user reviews or comments, providing valuable information on customer satisfaction and areas for potential improvement.

In summary, this data analysis project navigated through reading data from an SQLite database, data preparation, understanding Amazon's product recommendation methods, analyzing highly-reviewed products, investigating user behaviors, focusing on frequent users, and conducting sentiment analysis to glean comprehensive insights from the Amazon-related dataset.
